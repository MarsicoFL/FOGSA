Setting up
```{r}
library(pedprobr)
library(pedtools)
library(pedmut)
library(forrel)
```

The pedigree was generated with QuickPed and database from 300 SNPs was read.
```{r}
x <- readPed("Ancestros.ped")
db <- readFreqDatabase("300SNPs.txt", format = "ladder")
x = setMarkers(x, locusAttributes = db)
``` 

Plot. The grandchildren is 1 and the Missing Person is 9.
```{r}
plot(x)
```
Now, simulations. Team grat-grandparents.
```{r}
sel = list("24", c("24","25"), c("24","26"), c("24","25", "26"), c("24","25", "26", "27"), c("24", "22"), c("24", "25", "22", "23"), c("24", "25", "26", "27", "22", "23"), c("24", "25", "26", "27", "22", "23", "20", "21") )
simData3 = MPPsims(x, missing = "9", selections =  sel, addBaseline = FALSE, ep = TRUE, ip=TRUE, nProfiles = 10, lrSims = 1000, numCores = 12, seed = 1900)
```
Plots
```{r}
powerPlot(simData3, type = 4)
```
